This is a web-based music player that streams mp3s to your browser using HTML5 <audio> and has a jquery-heavy UI to navigate & queue tracks.  It has some developing functionality to lookup currently playing tracks using various music webservices in order to show questionably useful information.  Think of it like a drunk amarok 1.4 clone for the internet.

Features
* Catalogs a directory of mp3s and tags and joins them to the musicbrainz NGS schema
* Displays tree browser to browse and queue artists/albums/tracks
* Plays mp3s directly in your html5-audio-compliant, mp3-playing browser (chrome or safari)
* Displays data about currently playing artist, album and track information using a variety of webservices

Server dependencies
* python 2.6
* pylons w/ sqlalchemy, psycopg2 & repoze.what
* postgres
* mutagen
* lxml
* musicbrainz schema (core & derived)
